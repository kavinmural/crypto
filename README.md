# crypto
Worked with Java to create a program that encrypts and decrypts text files. This program receives an input file and uses a key to encrypt the file. Then, it outputs an encrypted file, which can be decrypted by the program with the correct key. Used this program to encrypt important documents on my USB, in case it was misplaced.
